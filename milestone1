Meeting Planning
	• What is your team's preferred communication method - email, text, bcourse messaging?
	• When will your team be holding meetings? How frequently will you meet? Are there times or days that work well for everyone?
	• Discuss future non-academic commitments that might affect members' availability.
	• Discuss meeting tempo: “checking in” at the beginning of meetings versus “just sticking to business”.

Roles
	• How is your team going to keep track of progress? Who will be taking minutes, creating agendas, and contacting the course facilitators with questions?
	• We encourage you to discuss potential dates and times to meet with a course facilitator during Weeks 3-5. Decide on the best date and time for all.
	• Determine a point person to submit each assignment for the team.

Conflict Management
	• If a conflict arises, plan to solve the issue as soon as possible. This is best done using synchronous (Zoom, Google Hangouts) communication rather than asynchronous (email).
	• If the group is unable to resolve the conflict, seek advice from the instructional team.
